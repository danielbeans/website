description: "My new years resolution to never stop building"

I've always had this idea to do something by every sunday. "Sunday snaps" or something like that. But 2 years have gone by and I haven't done anything close to it. Thus, the couple weeks late New Years resolution was born:

> Document what I learn, build, and fail at as undeniable proof that I'm not plateauing but in fact growing as an individual and in my craft.

This is not really intended as a blog for other people to see (although it appears immediately when you visit my site...). If you've stumbled across this, hello. I'm Daniel, a 25 year old lost in the sauce nerd that, after their quarter life crisis, is driven to not waste my "youth on the young".

Be your own witness to your greatness. Don't do it for anyone but yourself.
